## About

The objective of this project is to determine whether a given customer will have an accident or not (binary classification task). After a data exploration and processing phases, we will explore 3 machine learning models that we will evaluate with well-chosen metrics.

The code is in the notebook technical_test_with_descartes_underwriting.ipynb. It uses the Table of contents extension. For the notebook to be displayed better it is recommended to open it locally.

It breaks down as follows: 
- Project description
- Import libraries and data
- First data analysis
- Data exploration
- Data prepocessing
- Prediction task
- Hyperparameter tuning and export results
- Conclusion
